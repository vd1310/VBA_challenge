# VBA Challenge - Stock Market Analysis
### Refactor VBA code and measure performance of stocks for different years
## Overview of Project
Analyze an entire dataset of stocks to cover entire stock market over the last few years. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze performance of stocks of entire stock market, use refactoring to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the information needed to calculate stocks performance and daily volume. Also determine the code runtime to check if refactoring made code execute faster or not. 
## Objective
#### 1. Refactor Module 2 solution
#### 2. Determine whether refactoring was successful in executing VBA script run faster. 
#### 3. Compare stock performance
## Results: Please refer to VBA_Challenge_2017.png & VBA_Challenge_2018.png in the git hub repository vd1310/VBA_challenge. 
#### 1. Stocks results 2017: All the stocks gave positive performance except 'TERP' which was the least performing stock. The best performing stock of year 2017 was DQ with 199.4% growth. Code ran in 0.1484375 seconds
#### 2. Stocks results 2018: 2018 wasnâ€™t a great year for majority of the stocks, only two stocks (ENPH & RUN) showed positive returns. Best performing stock was RUN with 84% growth and the least performing stock was DQ with -62.6%. The code ran in .109375 seconds.
#### 3. Without refactoring the code execution time was .5859375 seconds. Thus refactoring helped in reducing the code execution time

## Summary
#### 1. Advantages in general:
Helps code run faster	
Makes code easier to understand
Debugging is easier
#### 2. Disadvantages: in general The process is time consuming
#### 3. Advantages of refactored VBA script:
The reference png files clearly shows that the code run time was successful reduced from .58 seconds to .1 seconds. Also a encountered errors in the first go, debugging was easier in the refactored layout. Disadvantage was to actually understand the code and write the loop with multiple if commands. With the help of TA I was able to debug the errors but it took time to write the code initially
